INSE 6260 Nurse Scheduling Project 
-----------------------



##Install
Project has various dependencies managed through Maven, NPM and Bower. Luckily they have all connected in Maven with frontend-maven-plugin.

To install all dependencies and run tests run:
```
$ mvn install
```
This command builds the application with default dev profile.
There are two profiles that build cycles include: `dev` (development) and `prod` (production). Each profile has its own build scenarios.

To install with explicit profile run `mvn install -P dev|prod`.

####Build cycle for dev profile

- Install Node and npm locally (If not installed).
- Install Node dependencies.
  - npm runs `bower install` after dependency installation. See `package.json`.
- Install Bower dependencies.
- Run Javascript tests and code coverage tool.
- Run Java tests with surefire.
- Compile and build WAR file.

####Build cycle for prod profile  

Difference between dev and prod profiles is, Javascript files are **built** in prod profile unlike dev. After running Javascript tests all javascript files are minified, concatenated, revved and prepared to the production, thanks to the various Grunt plugins. Please see the `build` task in `Gruntfile.js`.  
All the other steps are applied here too.
